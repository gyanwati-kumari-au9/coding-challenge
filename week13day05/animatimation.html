            <p><b>1914 translation by H. Rackham</b><br/>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous 
                indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure
                of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that 
                are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness
                of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are 
                perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
                untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure 
                is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims 
                of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be 
                repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to 
                this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, 
                or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
