Q. Draw the 7 layer OSI Model?
Answer:-
OSI Model:- OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.OSI model is a layered server
 architecture system in which each layer is defined according to a specific function to perform.
 All these seven layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one layer to another.
Architecture of OSI layers:-

PDU - protocol data unit

 1)Application Layer:-
Application layer interacts with an application program, which is the highest level of OSI model. 
The application layer is the OSI layer, which is closest to the end-user. It means OSI application 
layer allows users to interact with other software application.
Application layer interacts with software applications to implement a communicating component. 
The interpretation of data by the application program is always outside the scope of the OSI model.
Example of the application layer is an application such as file transfer, email, remote login, etc.

The function of the Application Layers are:
Application-layer helps you to identify communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication.
It allows users to log on to a remote host
This layer provides various e-mail services
This application offers distributed database sources and access for global information about various objects and services.
2)Presentation Layer:-
Presentation layer allows you to define the form in which the data is to exchange between the two communicating entities.
It also helps you to handles data compression and data encryption.

The function of Presentation Layers:
Character code translation from ASCII to EBCDIC.
Data compression: Allows to reduce the number of bits that needs to be transmitted on the network.
Data encryption: Helps you to encrypt data for security purposes â€” for example, password encryption.
It provides a user interface and support for services like email and file transfer.
3)Session Layer:-
Session Layer controls the dialogues between computers. It helps you to establish starting and terminating the connections between the local and remote application.
This layer request for a logical connection which should be established on end user's requirement. This layer handles all the important log-on or password validation.
Session layer offers services like dialog discipline, which can be duplex or half-duplex. It is mostly implemented in application environments that use remote procedure calls.

The function of Session Layer:
It establishes, maintains, and ends a session.
Session layer enables two systems to enter into a dialog
It also allows a process to add a checkpoint to steam of data.
4)Network Layer:-
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from one node to another connected in "different networks".
Message delivery at the network layer does not give any guaranteed to be reliable network layer protocol.
Layer-management protocols that belong to the network layer are:
routing protocols
multicast group management
network-layer address assignment.
5) Transport Layer:
The transport layer builds on the network layer to provide data transport from a process on a source machine to a process on a destination machine.
It is hosted using single or multiple networks, and also maintains the quality of service functions.
The functions of Transport Layers:
It divides the message received from the session layer into segments and numbers them to make a sequence.
Transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process on the destination machine.
It also makes sure that the entire message arrives without any error else it should be retransmitted.
6)Data Link Layer:-
Data link layer corrects errors which can occur at the physical layer. 
The layer allows you to define the protocol to establish and terminates a connection between two connected network devices.
The data link layer is subdivided into two types of sublayers:

*Media Access Control (MAC) layer- It is responsible for controlling how device in a network gain access to medium and permits to transmit data.
*Logical link control layer- This layer is responsible for identity and encapsulating network-layer protocols and allows you to find the error.
7) Physical Layer:-
The physical layer helps you to define the electrical and physical specifications of the data connection.
 This level establishes the relationship between a device and a physical transmission medium. 
 The physical layer is not concerned with protocols or other such higher-layer items.

Examples of hardware in the physical layer are network adapters, ethernet, repeaters, networking hubs, etc.
