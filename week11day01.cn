Q. Draw the 7 layer OSI Model?
Answer:-
OSI Model:- OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.OSI model is a layered server
 architecture system in which each layer is defined according to a specific function to perform.
 All these seven layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one layer to another.
 1)Application Layer:- At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers,
  we find Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. 
  These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. 
  This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network 
  and for displaying the received information to the user.
Ex: Application â€“ Browsers, Skype Messenger etc.
The functions of the Application layer are :

    1)Network Virtual Terminal
    2)FTAM-File transfer access and management
    3)Mail Services
    4)Directory Services

2) Presentation Layer :-Presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.
The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per 
the required format to transmit over the network.
The functions of the presentation layer are :
Encryption/ Decryption : Data encryption translates the data into another form or code.
 The encrypted data is known as the cipher text and the decrypted data is known as plain text.
  A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.
Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.
